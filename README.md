# Web-Page to Markdown Maverick

## Introduction

Web-Page to Markdown Maverick is a Chrome extension that allows users to easily convert web pages into Markdown format. This tool leverages the r.jina.ai service to generate Markdown content from any given URL, providing a seamless way to capture and save web content in a format suitable for note-taking, documentation, or content management systems.

## How it Works

1. The extension adds a button to your Chrome toolbar.
2. When you click the button on any web page, the extension sends the current URL to r.jina.ai.
3. r.jina.ai processes the web page and generates Markdown content.
4. The extension then downloads the generated Markdown file to your computer.
5. The file is named with the current date, time, and page title for easy organization.
